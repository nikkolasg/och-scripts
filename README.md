# och-scripts

This repository contains the tool that I coded during one of my internship. 
It's main goal is to fetch some files from a certain platform, format them in the right way, and finally process and aggregate the data
in a SQL database. It is capable of handling huge amounts of data, with fine granularity and is flexible enough to be used in any other 
kind of context. 

# Installation :
    - run install.sh. It should install
        -> ruby 1.9.3
        -> ruby-mysql package
        -> install Gems from Gemfile
        Please verify your installed packages. this script has NOT been tested.
    - Configure access to database in config.rb file
    - Enjoy.
